I am a Ph.D. candidate working with [Dr. Jean-Baptiste Poline](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/jean-baptiste-poline-phd) in the [NeuroDataScience-ORIGAMI](https://neurodatascience.github.io/) lab at McGill University.

My research focuses on discovering robust neuroimaging biomarkers of Parkinsonâ€™s disease progression using machine learning and statistical methods. 

A significant part of my current work is dedicated to open-source neuroinformatics software. I am the lead developer of the [Nipoppy](https://nipoppy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) framework for organizing and processing large neuroimaging-clinical datasets, and I am a core developer of the [Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/index.html) package for machine learning in neuroimaging.
